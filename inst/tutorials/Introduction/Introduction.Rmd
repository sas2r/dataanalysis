library(learnr)

```


## Topic 1

### Exercise 

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```

## Topic 2

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
adsl <- clinicalfd::adsl
head(adsl)
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```

```{r quiz2 }
quiz(
  question("How do read clinicalfd package into Rstudio?",
    answer("Just type in Clinicalfd"),
    answer("just type in clinicalfd"),
    answer("Just type in install(clinicalfd) ", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Do not type anything")
  ),
  
  question("How to use ADSL dataset and usubjid ?",
    answer("adsl <- clinicalfd::adsl ", correct = TRUE),
    answer("ADSL"),
    answer("clinicalfd.adsl"),
    answer("select (clinical::adsl , usubjid) ", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
